* The New Generation (NG) communication specification added the following features:
    1. End-to-end encryption support.
    2. An extended header to allow for the exchange of more information.
    3. A form system to allow the app to easily send required information to the server.
    4. A request system to allow NG apps to carry out administrative tasks in addition to accessing patient diet orders.
    4b. An authentication system to only allow authorized users to access/modify sensitive/administrative information.
    5. Proper replies for errors.
* The server still supports the LEGACY communication specification, though its use by NG apps is discouraged.
* Better handling of HTTP responses, including the sharing of `ng_com_spec` and this document.
